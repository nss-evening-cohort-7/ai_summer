# AI Summer
> Introduction to Transformer models, with practical applications to inferencing and training

Presented by Vanderbilt Data Science Institute data scientists:
* Dr. Jesse Spencer-Smith, Chief Data Scientist
* Dr. Charreau Bell, Senior Data Scientist
* Umang Chaudhry, Data Scientist

## Overview
The objective of these workshops is to develop foundational skills in understanding, inferencing and training Transformer models primarily using HuggingFace, an extremely user-friendly API for transformers.  

### Course Coverage

### Getting the Most out of this Course
To get the most out of this crash course in Python:
* Open Colab (workbook) notebooks and actively write code along with the instructor
* Actively participate in discussion
* Actively participate in breakout rooms
* Perform homework assignments before coming to class the next day
* Relax your mind and ask questions
* Let us know how you are doing using Fastcups at https://cups.fast.ai/vanderbilt-ai-summer!

## Workshop Schedule


## Breakout Rooms
During these workshops, we'll have a number of breakout rooms where you'll work with others for discussion or develop code to solve an assignment.  Please screenshot or paste your results in the following Google doc:

## Asynchronous (Homework) Assignments
A number of examples will be left to the reader.  Please complete these assignments prior to coming to the next day of the course.  These homework assignments are designed to augment your understanding of Python, enable you to avoid common pitfalls of programming, resolve known areas of ambiguity that often arise in our new learners, and navigate and understand common errors that Python will throw.
